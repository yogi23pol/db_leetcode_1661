In this context, it's important to note that the table names used in the examples include underscores and numbers, which differ from the naming conventions used in the LeetCode problem. In MySQL, all LeetCode problems are saved in a single database, so there will be duplicate table names when we deal with other LeetCode problems. It's important to keep this in mind when working with the code and ensure that the correct table names are used to avoid potential errors that may arise from naming inconsistencies.

The LeetCode problem uses the table name "Activity", in this context may use names such as "Activity_37". It's important to keep this difference in mind when working with the code and ensure that the correct table names are used.
